  <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
      I guess this is the section I'm supposed to talk about myself. There really isn't much to say but since the purpose of this site
      is to learn and test HTML code, I suppose I will give a little bit of my programming background. Let me start by saying that
      I am in no way a programmer. It has been something I have messed with a few times in my life by never really stuck with.
      My earliest memories of programming was using QBASIC on my old Atari XE system. I then did some C programming as a
      teen and in college. I took a couple of Visual Basic courses in college as well. Lastly, recently I've done some (very little)
      Unity and C# coding. I'm hoping that I stick with this HTML learning as I have a tendency to lose interest in stuff rather quickly.

      Mostly recently (early 2022) I started learning SQL as well. So there we are.

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>
    I've taken some classes from the College of Insurance in NY (now part of St. Johns). I took some courses from Berkley College
    in New York. I received my Associates Degree from Mount Wachusett Community College. Lastly, I am roughly 4 or 5 classes
    away from my Bachelors from UMASS Lowell. I've stopped going to college so it's unlikely I'll ever get to finish my bachelors
    but only time will tell. I've recently started getting the itch to go back to school, again. So this is possible. Maybe 2023?
